      <description>The objective of Loco3D is to build a methodology to execute a contact sequence, computed with an efficient motion planner, with a powerful humanoid robot inside a complex environment subject to dynamic changes. Planning and adapting complex locomotion patterns is a key problem that prevents from releasing humanoid robots and other legged manipulators in non-conventional factories, such as the assembly workshop of the Airbus A350 and A380 aircrafts in Toulouse, and beyond, the implementation of rehabilitation exoskeletons (e.g. for paraplegic) and the use service humanoid robots in offices, hospital and home environments.</description>

      <description>Humanoid Path Planner is a software platform aimed at solving motion planning problems for humanoid robots. It is also designed to solve classical (non humanoid) path planning problems.</description>

      <description>The project Memmo aims to solve the problem of generating complex movements for arbitrary robots with arms and legs interacting in a dynamic environment in real-time. Memmo will develop a unified yet tractable approach to motion generation for complex robots with arms and legs.</description>

      <title>Compliant Feedback Control of Legged Robots</title>
      <link>https://pfernbach.github.io/project/compliant-control/</link>

      <guid>https://pfernbach.github.io/project/compliant-control/</guid>
      <description>The goal of this project is to achieve reliable locomotion behaviors in semi-structured environments with the humanoid robots HRP-2 and Pyrene. This project relies on model-based feedback control techniques, such as inverse-dynamics and model predictive control.</description>
