We use HPP Loco3D, a versatile locomotion planner, to generate offline a set of dynamically consistent whole-body trajectory to be stored as the memory of motion. The learning problem is formulated as a regression problem to predict a single-step motion given the desired contact locations, which is then used as building block for multi-step motions. The predicted trajectory is then used as warm-starts for the fast optimal control solver Crocoddyl. We have shown that the approach manages to reduce the required number of iterations to reach the convergence from ∼9.5 to only ∼3.0 iterations for the single-step motion and from ∼6.2 to ∼4.5 iterations for the multi-step motion, while maintaining the solution's quality.

Validating a contact candidate implies \textit{a minima} the resolution of a slow, non-linear optimization problem, to demonstrate that a Center Of Mass (COM) trajectory, compatible with the contact transition constraints, exists. We propose a conservative reformulation of this trajectory generation problem as a convex 3D linear program, CROC. It results from the observation that if the COM trajectory is a polynomial with only one free variable coefficient, the non-linearity of the problem disappears. This has two consequences. On the positive side, in terms of computation times CROC outperforms the state of the art by at least one order of magnitude, and allows to consider interactive applications (with a planning time roughly equal to the motion time). On the negative side, in our experiments our approach finds a majority of the feasible trajectories found by a non-linear solver, but not all of them. Still, we demonstrate that the solution space covered by CROC is large enough to achieve the automated planning of a large variety of locomotion tasks for different robots, demonstrated in simulation and on the real HRP-2 robot, several of which were rarely seen before. Another significant contribution is the introduction of a Bezier curve representation of the problem, which guarantees that the constraints of the COM trajectory are verified continuously, and not only at discrete points as traditionally done. This formulation is lossless, and results in more robust trajectories. It is not restricted to CROC, but could rather be integrated with any method from the state of the art.","tags":["Multi contact locomotion ; centroidal dynamics ; Humanoid robots ; legged robots ; Motion planning"],"title":"C-CROC: Continuous and Convex Resolution of Centroidal dynamic trajectories for legged robots in multi-contact scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Olivier Roussel","Pierre Fernbach","Michel Taïx"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569794400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580838819,"objectID":"19af680a1849f58912fdb9854202f20a","permalink":"https://pfernbach.github.io/publication/tase19/","publishdate":"2019-09-30T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tase19/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper focuses on the motion planning problem of an extensible elastic rod in collision-free or contact space. The rod is assumed to be handled by grippers either at one or both extremities. Furthermore, during manipulation, the grasped end may change. We show that the use of both quasi-static and dynamic models can be coupled efficiently with sampling-based methods. Sampling directly in the submanifold of static equilibrium and contact-free configurations allows to take advantage of the dynamic model to improve the exploration of the state space. In this way, thanks to the contact information (point, forces, direction, number of contacts), the exploration of the RRT approach can be improved. We present a new RRT-SLIDE algorithm which guides the roadmap extension with a sliding contact mode based on some principles of human reasoning. We show that our approach is probabilistically complete. We also demonstrate the necessity of considering contacts on complex scenarios with several simulation experiments. Besides its performances , our algorithm does not require further tuning phase for a new scenario. Note to Practitioners-This work was done under the industrial project Flecto (ANR-Digital Models). It aims at solving the assembly/disassembly task for a rod while satisfying the elasticity parameters of its material. For industrial applications, the resolution time is a critical point. On the one hand, probabilistic motion planning methods require to efficiently build a roadmap of valid rod configurations. On the other hand, accurate rod modeling implies the use of a simulator based on the finite element method. Nevertheless, the very large size of the roadmap, that leads to a high number of calls to the simulator, is conflicting with the high computational cost of finite-element based simulation. To overcome this problem, one solution is to reduce the number of simulator calls. This can be achieved by sampling the free space with an efficient parameterization and by limiting the use of the simulator to roadmap extension in the free space or in the contact space. We introduce heuristics based on contact information returned by the simulator to reduce significantly the computational time. One of the main advantages of our algorithm is that it does not require any tuning phase for each scenario. Although we do not solve the more general gripper manipulation planning problem, this approach could be used as a first step before computing the motion of the grippers. In the framework of our project, we did not consider disassembling operations implying undoing rod knots. Consequently, we do not take friction into account in our approach. In order to handle knots, it would be necessary to have a physics simulator that could handle friction for deformable rods.","tags":["Motion planning ; contact planning ; sliding motion : elastic rod"],"title":"Motion Planning for an Elastic Rod using Contacts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Steve Tonneau","Daeun Song","Pierre Fernbach","Nicolas Mansard","Michel Taïx","Andrea Del Prete"],"categories":null,"content":"   ","date":1567288800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580838819,"objectID":"3d061eeab98bdf1fee773eee95383757","permalink":"https://pfernbach.github.io/publication/sl1m/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sl1m/","section":"publication","summary":" We present a novel method for computing centroidal dynamic trajectories in multi-contact planning context.

This general formulation could be straightforwardly used with any existing approach of the state of the art.

The use of a point mass model often results in physically inconsistent motions and joint limit violations. We mitigate these issues through the use of a novel formulation of the kinematic constraints which allows us to generate a quasi-static Center Of Mass trajectory, in a way that is both user-friendly and computationally efficient. We also show that the quasi-static constraint can be relaxed to generate motions usable for applications of computer graphics (on average 83% of a given trajectory remain physically consistent). Our method was integrated in our open-source contact planner and tested with different scenarios-some never addressed before-featuring legged characters performing non-gaited motions in cluttered environments.
