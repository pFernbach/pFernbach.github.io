Validating a contact candidate implies textita minima the resolution of a slow, non-linear optimization problem, to demonstrate that a Center Of Mass (COM) trajectory, compatible with the contact transition constraints, exists. We propose a conservative reformulation of this trajectory generation problem as a convex 3D linear program, CROC. It results from the observation that if the COM trajectory is a polynomial with only one free variable coefficient, the non-linearity of the problem disappears. This has two consequences. On the positive side, in terms of computation times CROC outperforms the state of the art by at least one order of magnitude, and allows to consider interactive applications (with a planning time roughly equal to the motion time). On the negative side, in our experiments our approach finds a majority of the feasible trajectories found by a non-linear solver, but not all of them. Still, we demonstrate that the solution space covered by CROC is large enough to achieve the automated planning of a large variety of locomotion tasks for different robots, demonstrated in simulation and on the real HRP-2 robot, several of which were rarely seen before. Another significant contribution is the introduction of a Bezier curve representation of the problem, which guarantees that the constraints of the COM trajectory are verified continuously, and not only at discrete points as traditionally done. This formulation is lossless, and results in more robust trajectories. It is not restricted to CROC, but could rather be integrated with any method from the state of the art.

With dynamic motion it is necessary to respect kinematic and dynamic constraints during the contact planning step. Verifying the feasibility of a transition between contacts increase the success rate of the motion generation along the planned contacts. Our approach is based on a conservative but convex reformulation of the problem where we represent the center of mass trajectory as a Bezier curve, with control points constrained by the initial and final states and one free control point. Thanks to the convexity of this formulation, we can solve it efficiently with a Linear Program of low dimension. We use this LP as a feasibility criterion to test the contact transition candidates during multi-contact planning. By incorporating this criterion in an existing sampling-based contact planner, we are able to produce more robust contact sequences. We illustrate this application on various multi-contact scenarios. We also show that we can compute valuable initial guess, used to warm-start non-linear solvers for motion generation methods.

We tackle this problem with a procedural approach that is generic, fully automatic and independent from motion capture data. The main contribution of this paper is a point-mass-model-based method to synthesize Center Of Mass trajectories. These trajectories are then used to generate the whole-body motion of the character. The use of a point mass model often results in physically inconsistent motions and joint limit violations. We mitigate these issues through the use of a novel formulation of the kinematic constraints which allows us to generate a quasi-static Center Of Mass trajectory, in a way that is both user-friendly and computationally efficient. We also show that the quasi-static constraint can be relaxed to generate motions usable for applications of computer graphics (on average 83% of a given trajectory remain physically consistent). Our method was integrated in our open-source contact planner and tested with different scenarios-some never addressed before-featuring legged characters performing non-gaited motions in cluttered environments. The computational efficiency of our trajectory generation algorithm (under ten ms to compute one second of motion) enables us to synthesize motions in a few seconds, one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods.

At the core of our framework is a new steering method that generates trajectories connecting two states of the robot.

HPP is an open-source answer to the lack of a standard framework for these important issues for robotics and graphics communities. HPP adopts a clear object oriented architecture, which makes it easy to implement parts of an existing planning algorithm, or entirely new algorithms. Python bindings and a visualization tool allow for fast problem setting and prototyping: a new algorithm can be implemented in just a few lines of code. HPP can be used for classic planning problems such as pick and place for mobile robots, but is specifically designed to solve problems where the motion of the robot is constrained. Examples of behaviors produced by HPP thanks to a generic constraint formulation include: maintaining a relative orientation between bodies, enforcing the static equilibrium of the robot, or automatically inferring that an object must be moved to allow locomotion. Constraints are tied to a custom representation of the kinematic chain, compatible with the Unified Robot Description format (URDF). To illustrate the possibilities of HPP, we present several recent scientific contributions implemented with HPP, most of which are provided with Python tutorials. HPP aims at being seamlessly integrated within a global robot control loop: Pinocchio, the fast multi-body dynamics library, is currently being integrated in HPP, thus bridging the gap between the planning and control communities.","tags":["manipulation ; legged robotics ; motion planning software"],"title":"HPP: a new software for constrained motion planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yannick Pencolé","Romain Pichard","Pierre Fernbach"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441058400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540468124,"objectID":"e581e816418a20de738c54d6593a6f8a","permalink":"https://pfernbach.github.io/publication/pencole15/","publishdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pencole15/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper addresses the problem of fault diagnosis in discrete-event system.
