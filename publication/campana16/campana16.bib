 abstract = { We present a framework capable of automatically planning and animating dynamic multi-contact jumping trajectories for arbitrary legged characters and environments. Our contribution is the introduction of an approximate yet efficient multi-contact impulse formulation, used at the motion planning phase. We combine this criterion with a heuristic for estimating the contact locations without explicitly computing them, which breaks the combinatorial aspect of contact generation. This low dimensional formulation is used to efficiently extend an existing ballistic motion planner to legged characters. We then propose a procedural method to animate the planned trajectory. Our approach thus results from a trade-off between accuracy of the law of physics and computational efficiency. We empirically justify this approach by demonstrating a large variety of behaviors for four legged characters in five scenarios. },
